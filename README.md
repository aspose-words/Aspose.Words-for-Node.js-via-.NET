## Getting Started with Aspose.Words for Node.js
Simply execute `npm install @aspose/words` to get the latest version & try any of the following code snippets.

### Create a DOCX using Node.js
Aspose.Words for Node.js allows you to create a blank Word document and add content to the file.
```js
const aw = require('@aspose/words');

// Create a Word document.
var doc = new aw.Document();

// Use a DocumentBuilder instance to add content to the file.
var builder = new aw.DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Write a new paragraph to the document.
builder.writeln('This is an example of a Word document created in Node.js');

// Save it as a DOCX file. The output format is automatically determined by the filename extension.
doc.save('OutputWordDocument.docx');
```

### Convert a Word document to HTML with Node.js
You can convert Microsoft Word to PDF, XPS, Markdown, HTML, JPEG, TIFF, and other file formats. The following snippet demonstrates the conversion from DOCX to HTML:
```js
const aw = require('@aspose/words');

// Load a Word file from the local drive.
var doc = new aw.Document('InputWordDocument.docx');

// Save it to HTML format.
doc.save('OutputHtmlDocument.html');
```

## Licensing

### Evaluate Aspose.Words
You can use `Aspose.Words for Node.js` free of cost for evaluation. The evaluation version provides almost all functionality of the product with certain limitations. The same evaluation version becomes licensed when you purchase a license and add a couple of lines of code to apply the license.

If you want to test `Aspose.Words for Node.js` without evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30 Day Temporary License. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/)

### Evaluation Version Limitations 
Evaluation version of `Aspose.Words for Node.js` without the specified license provides full product functionality, but inserts an evaluative watermark at the top of the document upon loading and saving and limits the maximum document size to a few hundred paragraphs.

### About the License
The license is a plain text XML file that contains details such as the product name, number of developers it is licensed to, subscription expiry date and so on. The file is digitally signed, so donтАЩt modify the file. Even inadvertent addition of an extra line break into the file will invalidate it.

You need to set a license before utilizing `Aspose.Words for Node.js` if you want to avoid its evaluation limitations. It is only required to set a license once per application (or process).

### Apply License 
The easiest way to set a license, is to put the license file to the application folder and specify the file name without its path.
```js
// Instantiate an instance of License calss and set the license file through its path
const aw = require('@aspose/words');
const license = new aw.License();
license.setLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");
```

However, if the license is obtained from an external source (e.g., a database), you can use a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer):
```js
const aw = require('@aspose/words');
const fs = require('fs');

// For testing purposes, let's simply read the license data from a file.
const data = fs.readFileSync('Aspose.Words.lic');

const license = new aw.License();
license.setLicense(data);
```
